# BioLab Copilot

BioLab Copilot is a local-first foundation for traceable biological experiment data analysis. The planned workflow is: import data, profile and quality-control it, confirm an analysis plan, run deterministic statistics, create charts, optionally obtain constrained AI-assisted interpretation, and export Word/Excel/JSON artifacts.

## Phase 0 status

Phase 0 establishes project governance, versioned Pydantic contracts, synthetic examples, and development checks. It intentionally contains no data reader, scientific calculation, curve fitting, AI integration, report renderer, or formal UI.

## Windows quick start

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,templates]"
python -m pytest -q
ruff check .
mypy src
```
